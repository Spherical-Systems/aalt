# AALT (Accelerated Analog Layout Tool)

AALT aims to increase the productivity of analog layout by keeping the human in the loop but automating the time consuming, monotonous activities:

 - Generation of matched current mirrors and differential pairs in guard rings and wells
 - DRC aware optimisation of sub-circuit blocks locations
 - Simple auto-routing along guided path
 
The goal is to improve analog layout speed by 50% by letting the computer do the boring work and leave the human to do the thinking.

### Tool Support

The primary tool that will be supported in [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de). Other tools may be added in the future.

PDK management is performed with [PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster). Examples with sky130 will be shown but any process with a PDKMaster definition can be used.
